## Simplified Instruction
We released the translationese GEC models (`TransGEC`) fine-tuned on (m)T5-large pre-trained language model. If you want to quickly explore our job, the following instructions may be useful to you.

- Step 1.  Requirements and Installation

This implementation is based on huggingface/[transformers(v4.13.0)](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) version >= 1.3.1
- Python version >= 3.6

```
git clone https://github.com/NLP2CT/Trans4GEC.git
cd transformers
pip install .
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Step 2.  Download Translationese (m)T5-GEC Models and Data
